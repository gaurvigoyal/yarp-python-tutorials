This repository contains open source software to start programming in YARP using Python.

[YARP]:http://www.yarp.it is an open source library designed for implementing robotics applications.


## INTRO
In the following you can find some tutorials for Python developers to start using YARP with:

1. [Ports](https://github.com/s4hri/yarp-python-tutorials/tree/master/workdir/tutorials/1_port)

2. [Buffered Port](https://github.com/s4hri/yarp-python-tutorials/tree/master/workdir/tutorials/2_buffered-port)

3. [Rpc](https://github.com/s4hri/yarp-python-tutorials/tree/master/workdir/tutorials/3_rpc)

4. [Callback](https://github.com/s4hri/yarp-python-tutorials/tree/master/workdir/tutorials/4_callback)

5. [RFModule](https://github.com/s4hri/yarp-python-tutorials/tree/master/workdir/tutorials/5_rfmodule)



## EXPLORE

In the following are implemented some example by using YARP for generical purpose, where communication are required
between different actors:

6. [producer-consumer](https://github.com/s4hri/yarp-python-tutorials/tree/master/workdir/tutorials/6_producer-consumer)

7. [publisher-subscriber](https://github.com/s4hri/yarp-python-tutorials/tree/master/workdir/tutorials/7_publisher-subscriber)


## TEST
At the end, some benchmarks have been implemented to test the performance

8. [YARP benchmarks](https://github.com/s4hri/yarp-python-tutorials/tree/master/workdir/tutorials/8_benchmarks)
